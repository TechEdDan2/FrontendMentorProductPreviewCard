## My process

### Built with

- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a fun project to practice a few different things and use IDs and Class attributes. I also played with ch units, letter-spacing, line-height, and a number of other text properties. 

### Continued development

I am pretty happy with how this turned out, but would always like feedback on how to make my css more efficient or cleaner.
